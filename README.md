# PythonCourse2022

This repository contains my exercises and the project for the 2022 instance of the course 'Advanced Scientific Programming in Python'

My preliminary choice of project is the travelling salesman problem (my own research mainly handles experimental work, so other than extracting data and plotting graphs, I don't have so much that uses python).
